-- Migration 010: dispatch never names a simulated truck as the "nearest truck"
-- Run once in Supabase -> SQL Editor, AFTER migration_009 (safe to run again).
-- Simulated trucks already never got real parcels; now they are also left out of the
-- explanation shown when no truck fits ("Nearest truck SM01SIM... is off duty").
